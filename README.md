Notes on things I need to fix: 
1. Login redirects back to home page but username is not shown -- must reload before it appears in top right corner -- want it to appear once redirect 
2. Must press search button twice before search results are shown 
3. Have to be able to set default username or have a username accepted from login 
4. To add a song to tracklist must re-render search screen between additions 
5. if we logout and refresh page -- it saves isLogged as truec--- cant have things like a list based on is logged
6. Have browse and app stuff hidden if not logged in
